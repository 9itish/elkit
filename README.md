# ElKit

ElKit is a lightweight, modular JavaScript library designed to simplify UI component development. It offers customizable, accessible, and easy-to-integrate components like Modals, Accordions, Countdowns, and more.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Modular**: Use only what you need.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Customizable**: Configure components to match your design.
- âš¡ **Lightweight**: No unnecessary bloat.
- ðŸ”§ **Configurable**: Supports detailed customization for each component.

## Installation

You can include the CSS and JavaScript files for each component you need via CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/elkit.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Since ElKit is modular, you can import only the components you need:

```javascript
import Modal from 'elkit/modal';
import Accordion from 'elkit/accordion';
import Countdown from 'elkit/countdown';
```

## Components

### 1. Modal
Create dynamic, customizable modals with backdrop and keyboard support.

```javascript
const modal = new Modal({
  width: '500px',
  backgroundColor: '#fff',
  closeOnBackdropClick: true
});
modal.open();
```

### 2. Accordion
Build collapsible content sections with ease.

```javascript
const accordion = new Accordion({
  multipleOpen: true
});
accordion.init();
```

### 3. Countdown Timer
Supports fixed end-time and duration-based modes, with pause and resume options.

```javascript
const timer = new Countdown({
  duration: 60,
  onEnd: () => console.log('Time up!')
});
timer.start();
```

## Configuration
Each component supports a variety of options for complete customization. Check the [Documentation](#) for detailed configuration options.

## Accessibility
ElKit components are designed with accessibility in mind, supporting ARIA roles and keyboard interactions.
